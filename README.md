# Air Quality

Air Quality is a hybrid [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org) application for collecting measurements that is currently developed by [Mapping for Change](http://mappingforchange.org.uk), and is supporting the [GeoKey platform](http://geokey.org.uk) developed by [Extreme Citizen Science](http://ucl.ac.uk/excites) research group at University College London.

## Requirements

Air Quality requires the [geokey-airquality](https://github.com/ExCiteS/geokey-airquality) extension to be installed alongside [GeoKey](https://github.com/ExCiteS/geokey).

## Build Application

Follow official documentation to [install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download). You may need to install [Git](http://git-scm.com/downloads) and [Ruby](http://ruby-lang.org/en/installation) too.

Install Bower, Grunt's Command Line Interface and Cordova globally:

```console
sudo npm install -g bower
sudo npm install -g grunt-cli
sudo npm install -g cordova
```

Navigate to project's directory and install required Bower components and npm modules locally:

```console
bower install
npm install
```

Copy configuration file from the sample with `cp config.sample.js config.js`. Edit application's configuration and add the URL of GeoKey platform used (without `/api/`), also client's ID.

Build Angular application:

```console
grunt
```

Download all the required Cordova plugins:

```console
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-dialogs
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-network-information
cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-geolocation
```

Also, add platforms (SDK must be installed for Android):

```console
cordova platform add browser
cordova platform add android
```

Build Air Quality application for all platforms:

```console
cordova build --release
```

Or individual platforms:

```console
cordova build --release browser
cordova build --release android
```

### Sign Android APK

Get the release key from Mapping for Change (including instructions), copy it to your working directory.

Sign the app (you will need to enter the build passphrase):

```console
jarsigner -verbose -sigalg SHA1withRSA -digestalg SHA1 -keystore airquality-key.keystore platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/android-release-unsigned.apk alias_name
```

Locate the zipalign tool (usually inside `/path/to/Android/sdk/build-tools/<version>/zipalign`) and run the following:

```console
zipalign -v 4 platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/android-release-unsigned.apk air-quality.apk
```

For example, on OS X with Android SDK version 25.0.2, the command should be:

```console
~/Library/Android/sdk/build-tools/25.0.2/zipalign -v 4 platforms/android/build/outputs/apk/android-release-unsigned.apk air-quality.apk
```

The finalised signed app can then be uploaded to [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/apps/publish/).

Please note, Cordova previously was adding additional "8" at the end of generated Android version code. This has changed in the later updates. Following the default settings, Google Play store will not allow to upload any *new* versions of the app, as they will all be threated as lower versions. A workaround was added, where Android version code *must be* explicitly set in the XML configuration file.

## Develop Application

When building Angular application, use:

```console
grunt dev
```

Changes will be watched and applied when saving.

When Air Quality application is compiled, test it on the emulator:

```console
cordova emulate <platform>
```

To test the app on the actual Android device, use:

```console
cordova run android --target=<device>
```

Run `adb devices` to see all available Android devices.

## Run Unit Tests

All tests are written in [Jasmine](https://github.com/pivotal/jasmine).

Install Karma's Command Line Interface globally:

```console
sudo npm install -g karma-cli
```

Follow official documentation to [install PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/download.html).

Navigate to project's directory, build Angular application, then run:

```console
npm test
```

You can pass custom arguments by adding `--` between the command and arguments, for example, `npm test -- --no-single-run` will continue running tests after a change is being made to the files (either app or tests).

Coverage report is generated inside the `coverage` directory.
